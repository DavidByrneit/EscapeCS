The "Hexadecimal" or simply "Hex" numbering system uses the base of 16. It is a popular choice for representing long binary values because their format is relatively compact and much easier to understand than that long binary strings of 1 and 0. 
    It uses sixteen different digits with a combination of numbers from 0 through 15. In other words, there are 16 possible digit symbols. However, there is one potential problem with using it caused by the fact that the decimal numbers of 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 are usually written with two adjacent symbols. For example, when we write 10 in hexadecimal, we mean that the decimal number ten or the binary number two (1 + 0). To get around this tricky problem, hexadecimal numbers that have the values of ten, eleven fifteen are replaced with capital letters from A, B, C, D, E, and F. Then, we use the numbers in the hexadecimal numbering system from 0 to 9 and the capital letters A to F to represent the binary, or decimal number Hexadecimal numbers are a more complex system than using Binary or decimal only and is mainly used when dealing with computers and memory Address locations. When programming, often it is indicated that a number is a Hexadecimal number rather than a decimal number when written in the Format "0x ??" -> 0x0f is decimal 15. '
