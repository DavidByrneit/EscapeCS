                            is quite long. <br> <br>
                            If you work with large digital systems like computers,
                            It is common to find binary numbers made up of 8, 16, and even 32 digits
                            makes it difficult to both read and write without generating errors, especially when
                            Work with many 16 or 32 bit binary numbers. <br> <br>
                            A common way to overcome this problem is to solve the problem
                            Binary numbers in groups or sets of four bits (4 bits). These groups of 4-bit
                            uses a different type of numbering system that is also commonly used in computers and digital media
                            Systems called hexadecimal numbers. <br> <br>
                            The "Hexadecimal" or simply "Hex" numbering system uses the
                            Basis of the 16 system and are a popular choice for representing long binary values
                            because their format is quite compact and much easier to understand than that
                            long binary strings of 1 and 0. <br> <br>
                            The base 16 system is the hexadecimal numbering system
                            therefore uses 16 (sixteen) different digits with a combination of numbers from 0
                            through 15. In other words, there are 16 possible digit symbols. <br> <br>
                            There is one potential problem with using it, however
                            Method of digit notation caused by the fact that the decimal numbers of 10, 11, 12,
                            13, 14 and 15 are usually written with two adjacent symbols. <br> <br>
                            For example, when we write 10 in hexadecimal, we mean that
                            the decimal number ten or the binary number two (1 + 0). To get around this
                            tricky problem hexadecimal numbers that have the values ​​of ten, eleven,. .
                            . , fifteen are replaced with capital letters from A, B, C, D, E, and F.
                            each. <br> <br>',
    'text2' => 'Then we use the numbers in the hexadecimal numbering system
                        from 0 to 9 and the capital letters A to F to represent the binary or decimal number
                        Equivalent starting with the least significant digit on the right. <br> <br>
                        As we just said, binary strings can be quite long as well
                        hard to read but we can make life easier by splitting this large binary file
                        Numbers in even groups to make them much easier to write down and understand. <br> <br>
                        For example the following group of binary digits 1101
                        0101 1100 11112 are much easier to read and understand than 11010101110011112
                        when they are re all clumped together. <br> <br>
                        In everyday use of the decimal number system we use
                        Groups of three digits or thousands from the right to make a very large number
                        like a million or trillions that are easier for us to understand, and the same is true
                        in digital systems. <br> <br>
                        Hexadecimal numbers are a more complex system than using
                        Binary or decimal only and is mainly used when dealing with computers and memory
                        Address locations. By dividing a binary number into groups of 4 bits, each group becomes
                        or a set of 4 digits can now have a possible value between "0000" (0) and "1111" (
                        8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15) gives a total of 16 different number combinations from 0 to 15.
                        Don not forget that "0" is also a valid digit. <br> <br>
