    'text1' => 'ES The one main disadvantage of binary numbers is that the binary string equivalent of a
                            large decimal base-10 number can
                            be quite long.<br><br>
                            When working with large digital systems, such as computers,
                            it is common to find binary numbers consisting of 8, 16 and even 32 digits which
                            makes it difficult to both read or write without producing errors especially when
                            working with lots of 16 or 32-bit binary numbers.<br><br>
                            One common way of overcoming this problem is to arrange the
                            binary numbers into groups or sets of four bits (4-bits). These groups of 4-bits
                            uses another type of numbering system also commonly used in computer and digital
                            systems called Hexadecimal Numbers.<br><br>
                            The “Hexadecimal” or simply “Hex” numbering system uses the
                            Base of 16 system and are a popular choice for representing long binary values
                            because their format is quite compact and much easier to understand compared to the
                            long binary strings of 1’s and 0’s.<br><br>
                            Being a Base-16 system, the hexadecimal numbering system
                            therefore uses 16 (sixteen) different digits with a combination of numbers from 0
                            through to 15. In other words, there are 16 possible digit symbols.<br><br>
                            However, there is a potential problem with using this
                            method of digit notation caused by the fact that the decimal numerals of 10, 11, 12,
                            13, 14 and 15 are normally written using two adjacent symbols.<br><br>
                            For example, if we write 10 in hexadecimal, do we mean
                            the decimal number ten, or the binary number of two (1 + 0). To get around this
                            tricky problem hexadecimal numbers that identify the values of ten, eleven, . .
                            . , fifteen are replaced with capital letters of A, B, C, D, E and F
                            respectively.<br><br>',
    'text2' => 'ES Then in the Hexadecimal Numbering System we use the numbers
                        from 0 to 9 and the capital letters A to F to represent its Binary or Decimal number
                        equivalent, starting with the least significant digit at the right hand side.<br><br>
                        As we have just said, binary strings can be quite long and
                        difficult to read, but we can make life easier by splitting these large binary
                        numbers up into even groups to make them much easier to write down and understand.<br><br>
                        For example, the following group of binary digits 1101
                        0101 1100 11112 are much easier to read and understand than 11010101110011112
                        when they are all bunched up together.<br><br>
                        In the everyday use of the decimal numbering system we use
                        groups of three digits or 000’s from the right hand side to make a very large number
                        such as a million or trillion, easier for us to understand and the same is also true
                        in digital systems.<br><br>
                        Hexadecimal Numbers is a more complex system than using
                        just binary or decimal and is mainly used when dealing with computers and memory
                        address locations. By dividing a binary number up into groups of 4 bits, each group
                        or set of 4 digits can now have a possible value of between “0000” (0) and “1111” (
                        8+4+2+1 = 15 ) giving a total of 16 different number combinations from 0 to 15.
                        Don’t forget that “0” is also a valid digit.<br><br>
