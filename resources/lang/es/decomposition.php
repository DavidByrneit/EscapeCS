                        and manage the problem better. For large, complex problems – we can then analyze, solve and
                        design the smaller parts of the problem and then put it all together for a solution.</p>
                    <p>Example # 1 – Simple decomposition example from our daily life – Late for school</p>
                    <p>You have been late to school 3 times this week. You’d like to fix the problem and be on time
                        starting tomorrow. To start with, define the problem.</p>

                                <li>Organize your sock drawer! Do it anyway, even if you’re not running late! And
                                    possibly put fresh socks in your shoes and place them by the door also.</li>

                                    to leave.</li>

                                <li>How about rinsing and filling your water bottle in the night and setting it in the

                                <li>Lay out your “outfit” for the next day so you’re not wasting time looking for them
                                    in the morning.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <li>I organize all the above but wake up late and then have to rush: </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Set an early alarm so you have enough time to get ready.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <li>I end up shutting it off and going back to sleep:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Set 2 alarms then! Convince your neighbor to buy a rooster! Whatever helps you get
                                    up and going on time.</li>
                            </ul>

                        <br>
                        Now, start implementing 1 or more of the potential solutions and see which one or which
                        combination helps you get to school on time.</p>'
