                Maybe I overeaceted maybe things arent as bad as it seems. I do think we need to have a better understanding in our past ,we are losing skills that are
                still needed today ,what will you do when you cheats and librarys fail you.</p>
                <p>What if OS systems stop working or shut you out. The old ways will always work and they will make you a better programmer. Maybe there is hope if we can make it accessible to everyone maybe more will participate.</p>
                <p>Anyway you have solved my little trials I will turn your website back to normal when I get a chance,Im doing things the old ways it might take awhile.</p>',
