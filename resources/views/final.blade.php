                    <p>Well here we are ,you have done it stepped through all my layers of abstraction to reach us here.</p>
                   <p> Maybe i overeaceted maybe things arent as bad as it seems.</p>
                   <p> I do think we need to have a better understanding in our past ,we are losing skills that are still needed today ,what will you do when you cheats and librarys fail you.</p>
                   <p> What if OS systems stop working or shut you out.The old ways will always work and they will make you a better programmer.</p>

                   <p> But then i also see this </p>

                   <p> Maybe there is hope if we can make it accessible to everyone maybe more will participate.</p>
                    

                    <p>Anyway you have solved my little trials il turn your website back to normal when i get a chance ,im doing things the old ways it might take awhile.</p>
